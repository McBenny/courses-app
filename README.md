# Courses exercise

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

### Requirements
Requirements come from `https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app`

- Node v10.16 or more recent
- NPM v5.6 or more recent

Tested with node v12.18.2 and NPM v6.14.5

### Process
- Installation: `npm install`
- Run the app: `npm start`

## Design

### Responsiveness

### Compatibility
No constraints being set regarding the target browsers, I used freely some CSS features (Grid, custom properties,
alternative generated content) famous for not being supported by some older browsers (IE and early versions of Edge).

## Interactivity

## Accessibility
There is no specific accessibility effort put in here, just a respect of best practices, so no accessibility warning
should be apart from colour contrast.

## Testing
